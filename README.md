# pmdiet -- Prairie Manor Dietary Management Software
Software to replace extensive binders, cards, checklists, reference sheets, and order slips used by many healthcare dietary departments, using inexpensive android tablets for the front-end, and a PHP/MySQL back-end.

## Developer Information
So far, here is the plan.  Feel free to improve it as necessary and send me a pull request of your fork!

There are three parts to this project:

1. A PHP/MySQL backend, which interacts with the android clients
2. A web front-end for the dietary manager to make changes from her desktop (potentially using a framework like codeigniter)
3. An Android front-end for dietary aides to use

### PHP/MySQL backend
